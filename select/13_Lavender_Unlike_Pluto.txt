Where to begin
I’ll play along if you pretend
I’m in the wind
In a season that never ends
A traveler
Drift in and out just like the air
Spectacular
It’s in the air like lavender
Find me
Off the coast of Italy
Hiding
Any trace of my history
Too long
I’ve been going anywhere but home
Too gone
I have always been a rolling stone
A traveler
Drift in and out just like the air
Spectacular
It’s in the air like lavender
Running
Always thinking home can wait on me
It’s funny
How this freedom really isn’t free
Too long
I’ve been going anywhere but home
Too gone
I have always been a rolling stone
Where to end
I’ll play along if you pretend
Indifferent
Went round the globe, back where I began
A traveler
Drift in and out just like the air
Spectacular
It’s in the air like lavender
